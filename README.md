# 👋 Hi, I'm Ömer Cihan Demir

### 🤖 Autonomous Software Developer | Robotics Enthusiast | Team Lead

I am a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student at Bursa Technical University. My curiosity for software and electronics, which started at a young age, led me to actively develop myself through the MATRO (Machine Technologies, Robotics, and Automation) Community after starting university.

Throughout this journey, my growing interest in robotic systems has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in computer vision, autonomous driving algorithms, motor control, sensor integration, embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano), and ROS2.

I have taken part in Teknofest projects both as a team member and a team leader. These experiences not only strengthened my technical skills but also significantly contributed to my abilities in teamwork, communication, and leadership. Enjoying knowledge sharing, I have delivered training sessions and seminars on robotic systems within student communities and at various institutions.

Personally, I consider myself curious, highly motivated, and determined. I am not hesitant to take responsibility, I approach problems with a solution-oriented mindset, and I am always eager to explore and experiment with new technologies. As an open communicator, I value creating a trust-based team environment and believe in achieving success through collaboration.

My goal is to contribute to impactful projects in the field of robotics by leveraging both my technical and social skills, while continuously learning and improving myself.
